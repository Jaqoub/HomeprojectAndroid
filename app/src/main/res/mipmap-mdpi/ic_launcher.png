 * configuration change (e.g. rotation). The new instance of the owner will just re-connected to the
 * existing ViewModel.

 * The purpose of the ViewModel is to acquire and keep the information that is necessary for an
 * Activity or a Fragment. The Activity or the Fragment should be able to observe changes in the
 * ViewModel. ViewModels usually expose this information via {@link LiveData} or Android Data
 * Binding. You can also use any observability construct from you favorite framework.
